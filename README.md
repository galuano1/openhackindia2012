Pull request to improve/modify your profile.

## Motivation

We are at Yahoo Open Hack 2012 and it's amazing: a huge gathering of about 1,000 hackers. 
The best part is: you know that the person sitting next to you is a passionate coder too, 
because who else would spend his week-end in a dark room with his computer on his lap except a true passionate hacker?

But it's sad. On Sunday evening, everybody will go home and then it's over. Bye bye everyone. 
See you at next year's Yahoo Open Hack. Maybe. Why do we have to dissolve this community? 
Why can we not build something on this huge pool of code lovers?
 
## Solution

We need to keep alive the community. 
So we created an instant search engine to help you keep in touch with your fellow hackers after the event. 
Best of all the index of the engine is open sourced on Github. 
So everyone can contribute to it and update his/her profile.

Keep it hacking!
